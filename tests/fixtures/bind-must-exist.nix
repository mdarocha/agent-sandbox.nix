# Test fixture: declared rwDir / rwFile pointing at HOME-relative paths.
# The test overrides HOME to a throwaway dir and controls whether the
# declared paths exist before each launch, so all four cases (both
# missing / only rwDir / only rwFile / all present) can be exercised
# against this single fixture.
