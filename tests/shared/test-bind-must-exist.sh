# Test: declared rwDirs / rwFiles must exist on the host before the sandbox
# launches.
#
# The wrapper used to silently `mkdir -p` declared rwDirs and `touch` declared
# rwFiles at launch. That hid typos like `rwDirs = [ "$HOME/.cluade" ]` — the
# agent would populate the misspelled directory and the real ~/.claude config
# would diverge silently. After this change the wrapper checks each declared
# path with `[ -e ]` (so broken symlinks also fail), accumulates every missing
# path, prints one error line per miss, and exits 1 before any sandboxing runs.
