# Legacy-argument migration errors (shared across platforms).

# Each removed/renamed mkSandbox argument (extraEnv, stateDirs, stateFiles,
# restrictNetwork) must fail at *eval* time with the migration message from
# shared.assertNoLegacyArgs — never silently build under the old name.
#
# We force the wrapper to WHNF with `builtins.seq wrapper "ok"`, which fires
# the assertNoLegacyArgs `seq` guard without realising the derivation (so no
# closure is built — the eval stays cheap).
